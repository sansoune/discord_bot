# My discord bot
i am creating this bot to manage my discord server; it's totaly customable and containerized to host on docker

---
if you want  to use the code type ``git clone https://github.com/sansoune/discord_bot``
create a ``config.json`` in src to handle every thing like token or welcome channel id or log channel id
and create ``.env`` in src/prisma folder. you have to put ``DATABASE='your postgres url database'``

to use the memes create a folder named images inside src and put the memes there. if you are like me you want some fun and make your friend upload their own memes run the script in the backend an portforward it to port 80.
that's it and have fun
